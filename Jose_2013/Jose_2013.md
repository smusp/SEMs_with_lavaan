# Three-variable mediation with cross-sectional data


Jose, P. (2013). Doing Statistical Mediation and Moderation. New York,
NY: Guilford Press.

This example shows how to obtain a three-variable mediation analysis
using lavaan; including how to obtaining indirect and total effects. In
Chapter 3 (Basic Mediation, pp. 43-92), Jose describes a basic mediation
model involving three variables: Positive Life Events; Happiness; and
Gratitude. Positive Life Events has a direct effect on Happiness, but
also Positive Life Events has an indirect effect on Happiness via
Gratitude.

#### Load relevant packages

First, load the lavaan and haven packages.

``` r
library(lavaan)
library(haven)   # To read SPSS data files
```

#### Get the data

The data are available at the Guilford Press site (note that the url
given on page 48 is not longer a valid link). The data are contained in
an SPSS data file. The haven package allows R to read SPSS data files.
Examine the file structure, in particular, noting the variable names.
These will be needed by lavaan.

``` r
dataset <- data.frame(haven::read_spss("http://www.guilford.com/add/jose/mediation_example.sav"))

str(dataset)
head(dataset)
summary(dataset)
```

The labels for the three variables are:

- ple - Positive Life Events
- grat - Gratitude
- shs - Happiness

#### The model

The model is given in Figure 3.3 (p. 46), reproduced below.

Using lavaan, mediation effects can be estimated using the `:=`
operator. In the diagram, the effects are labelled are a, b, and c$'$,
in the model statement they are labelled a, b, and cpr.

``` r
model <- "
  # direct effect
  shs ~ cpr * ple

  # mediator
  grat ~ a * ple
  shs ~  b * grat

  # indirect effect (a*b)
  indirect := a * b

  # total effect
  total := cpr + (a * b) 
"
```

#### Fit the model and get the results

I’ve requested unstandardised and standardised effects, and
R<sup>2</sup> values. For the standardised effects, see the “std.all”
column in the output.

``` r
fit <- sem(model, data = dataset)
summary(fit, rsquare = TRUE, standardized = TRUE)
```

Jose conducts mediation analysis using regressions. He presents the
results of the regression analyses in a series of tables: 3.2 to 3.5
(pp. 49-52). The unstandardised and standardised coefficients in the
tables agree with the lavaan output.

In the regression summary tables, Jose presents the constant (that is,
the intercept). If the intercepts are required, include
`meanstructure = TRUE` in lavaan’s `sem()` function.

``` r
fit_intercepts <- sem(model, data = dataset, meanstructure = TRUE)
summary(fit_intercepts, rsquare = TRUE, standardized = TRUE)
```

Jose shows how to calculate and test the statistical significance of
Sobel’s z-value (that is, testing the significance of the indirect
effect) on pages 53 and 54. Do not rely on that test, similarly do not
rely of the t-test for the indirect effect given in the lavaan output.
It is better to calculate confidence intervals, although the symmetric
confidence intervals presented in Table 3.7 (p. 55) are no better than
the test for Sobel’s z-value. The asymmetric CIs presented in Table 3.8
(p. 56) are possibly better. In lavaan, bootstrap CIs can be calculated.

``` r
fit_boot <- sem(model, data = dataset, se = "bootstrap", bootstrap = 2000)
summary(fit_boot, standardized = TRUE, ci = TRUE)
parameterEstimates(fit_boot, boot.ci.type = "perc")
```

The R script with minimal commenting is available in
[mediation.r](mediation.r).
